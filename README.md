# Simple Storage â€“ Solidity Basics

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of writing smart contracts using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/). It contains a simple contract that stores and retrieves a number on the Ethereum blockchain.

## ðŸ§± Overview

The **SimpleStorage** contract allows you to:
- Store a single unsigned integer (`uint256`)
- Retrieve the stored value

This project is perfect for learning:
- Solidity syntax
- Smart contract deployment
- Interaction with deployed contracts

## ðŸ§ª Prerequisites

To follow along, make sure you have:

- MetaMask (for interacting with the blockchain, if deploying)
